# Manual deployment

If you plan to direct your users to manually download and configure the WARP client, they can do so in two ways, depending on your organization's Teams configuration:

If your organization wants to implement the WARP client in the [Gateway with WARP mode](/connections/connect-devices/warp#warp-client-modes), users will need to connect the client to your organization's Cloudflare for Teams instance. This is not needed if your organization only wants to enforce DNS filtering.
