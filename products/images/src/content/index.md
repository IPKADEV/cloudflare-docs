# Cloudflare Images API (beta)

Cloudflare Images API provides an end-to-end solution to build your image pipeline.  It aims to answer the most common challenges associated with building and maintaining your image infrastructure:

1. “Where do we store images?”
1. “How do we secure, resize, and optimize the images for different use cases?”
1. “How do we serve the images to our users reliably?”
1. “How do we do all of these things at scale while having predictable and affordable pricing, especially during spikes?”
